    <h1>Privacy Policy & Service Terms — AssessmentBuddy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: <%= new Date().toLocaleDateString() %></p>

    <p><strong>AssessmentBuddy</strong> provides academic support services (PPTs, assessments (MS Word), and resumes) to students. This page explains how we handle your data, our refund and modification policy, and the terms you accept when placing an order.</p>

    <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contact & order data:</strong> name, WhatsApp number, course, service type, topic/title (if applicable), deadline, additional notes, and optional resume details (name, qualification, experience, certifications, specialization).</li>
      <li><strong>Order metadata:</strong> timestamps, order status, payment status, and order ID.</li>
      <li>We <strong>do not</strong> collect or sell your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How we use your data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To fulfil orders: create PPTs, write assessments, or prepare resumes as requested.</li>
      <li>To contact you about your order (via WhatsApp or email) for clarifications or delivery.</li>
      <li>To maintain basic records for business and quality control (no profiling or resale of data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data sharing & security</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Your order information is accessible only to the AssessmentBuddy team members who prepare your document.</li>
      <li>We store data in our secured MongoDB instance (MongoDB Atlas). We use reasonable technical measures to protect your data, but no system is 100% secure.</li>
      <li>If required by law (valid court order, government request), we may disclose data to comply—otherwise we will not share your information with outside parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Payment, Refunds & Charges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Non-refundable payments:</strong> All payments are final and non-refundable once completed. By paying, you acknowledge that our team immediately begins work on your order.</li>
      <li>We recommend verifying order details (service type, deadline, topic, and any uploaded files) before paying.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Modification & Correction Window</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>After delivery, the customer has a <strong>2-hour window</strong> to request changes or corrections. Requests must be reasonable and limited to modify content, correct personal details, or fix formatting/typos.</li>
      <li>Change requests submitted within the 2-hour window are reviewed and applied at our discretion and capacity. If the change is outside scope (major rewrite) additional charges may apply; we will inform you before proceeding.</li>
      <li>Requests received after the 2-hour window will not be accepted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Delivery & Deadlines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We aim to deliver orders within the agreed timeframe (typically within 24 hours for standard requests). Rush or emergency deliveries may have extra charges and must be clearly requested at the time of order.</li>
      <li>If you provide incorrect or late information which causes delay, the original deadline may be postponed; we will notify you via WhatsApp.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property & Usage</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Documents we create for you (PPTs, Word files, resumes) are delivered to you for personal/academic use. AssessmentBuddy retains no claim over your usage rights after delivery.</li>
      <li>You must not use our deliverables to commit academic dishonesty. We prepare content according to your instructions; responsibility for submission and adherence to your institution’s rules lies with you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Liability & Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AssessmentBuddy provides content and formatting services. We do not guarantee grades, acceptance, or specific academic outcomes.</li>
      <li>We are not responsible for consequences arising from misuse of our work or violation of institutional policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Orders can be cancelled only before work starts. Because work typically begins immediately after payment, cancellations are rarely possible; contact us immediately if you need to cancel.</li>
      <li>If we accept a cancellation, refund decisions are made case-by-case and may be partial or zero depending on work performed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Contact & Support</h2>
    <p>If you need support, want to request a change within the 2-hour window, or have a dispute, contact us immediately:</p>
    <p><strong>Email:</strong> kumarhimanshu7988@gmail.com<br />

    <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy occasionally. The latest version is always available on this page. Continued use of AssessmentBuddy after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <p class="muted">By placing an order you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed to this Privacy Policy & Service Terms.</p>
